Template and script to build a static bookmark file to be used as the browser
default start page in new windows and tabs.

Browsers may require different extensions to make this possible. Some don't
allow local files as start pages by default.

Just add new bookmarks in the Markdown file, and run the `mk.sh` script.

Requires [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
